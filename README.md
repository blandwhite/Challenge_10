## Background

In this Challenge, we’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so we want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing our proposal on only returns and volatility, we will include other factors that might impact the crypto market — leading to better performance for your portfolio.

When we present the idea, our manager loves it! So, we’re asked to create a prototype for submitting our crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

## What's Being Created

In this Challenge, we’ll combine our financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that we acquired in this module.

We’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. We’ll then plot the results so that we can visually show the performance to the board.

The CSV file that’s provided for this Challenge contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Python libraries used:

 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - *an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.*
 - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html) - *a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
 - [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - *a high-level plotting API for the PyData ecosystem built on HoloViews.*
 - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - *an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.*


### Installation Guide

prior to running these libraries, install them from the command line:
  - pandas: `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`  
  - pathlib: `pip install pathlib`
  - hvPlot: `conda install -c pyviz hvplot` or `pip install hvplot`
  - sklearn: `pip install-U scikit-learn` - included in conda

## Usage

After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means?
